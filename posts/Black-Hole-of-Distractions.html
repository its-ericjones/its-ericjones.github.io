      <h1>The Black Hole of Distractions and Configurations</h1>
      <span class="post-date"><em>Date: Oct 08, 2023</em></span>
      <p>I tend to find that if I’m presented with the opportunity to tinker and configure settings rather than just getting down to work, I can easily spend hours doing that and at the end of the day be annoyed that I didn’t actually doing anything productive. I’m now at that point in my “computing life” where I value a workspace that simply works and allows me to get to what actually matters rather than fiddling around endlessly trying to find that “perfect setup”.</p>
