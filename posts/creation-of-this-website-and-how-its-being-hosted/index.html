      <h2 id="creation">Creation</h2>
<p>At first I was really into the idea of creating this website by hand only using HTML and CSS. As I began to work I soon realized that even though this approach is good for overall development (pun intended), I just don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth to devote this much time to it. My main priority is to continue working on my automation and Python skills as well as writing content to publish online.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. This is a static site generator tool that, at a high level, allows you to create posts entirely in plain text with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and easily have these files be converted into their HTML/CSS/JS counterparts.</p>
<p>Using Hugo at this point in time will allow me to continue focusing on improving my programming skills which is at the top of my to do list. At some point down the line I do intend to recreate this website entirely by hand but for now, Hugo will do just fine.</p>
<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>
<p>This website is being hosted via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Each time I make changes, I can run the <code>hugo</code> command to easily recompile all the site files into a local <strong>public</strong> directory. This directory is part of a remote GitHub repository that is automatically updated via a simple script.</p>
<p>The domain name was purchased through <a href="https://www.namecheap.com">Namecheap</a> and it was pretty straightforward to configure Custom DNS to point to GitHub&rsquo;s name servers.</p>
