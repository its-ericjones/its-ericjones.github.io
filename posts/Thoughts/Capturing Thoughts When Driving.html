            <p>When listening to podcasts while I'm driving to work, I often think of things that I want to expand on later. I find that if I don't capture these thoughts right away then I'm trying to to juggle remembering exactly what I want to act on later while also trying to listen to the remainder of the podcast. This is a pretty poor system because I'm not fully invested in what I'm listening to and therefore there are a lot of moments that I either have to rewind, or I restort to re-listening to part of the podcast at a later time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My solution to this is using the <a href="https://getdrafts.com" target="_blank">Drafts</a> complication on my Apple Watch to quickly dictate my thoughts after briefly pausing the episode. This then syncs to my iPhone, and with badge notifications on I can know that I have one new draft containing whatever my thoughts were when I was driving. Then later when I have time, I can go into the Drafts app on my iPhone or my Mac and decide what I want to do with that text specifically - whether it's a potential blog post idea, something that I want to put into Reminders, something I want to email, etc.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>For longer form thoughts when driving I have a pair of wired lightning EarPods that I plug into my iPhone, and with the iOS 16 update there is no longer a cap on dictation time. This allows me to pause when I need to when dictating. It also helps that speaking into the microphone on the headphones seems considerably more accurate than the Apple Watch microphone.</p>
