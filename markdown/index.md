A 29 year old nerd and photographer figuring out his place on this giant spinning rock we call Earth.

Hey there, Iâ€™m Eric. ðŸ‘‹
=======================

Welcome to my little home on the Internet! Feel free to come on in, kick back, and stay a while!

### Check out my tech endeavors.

Iâ€™m a hobbyist programmer and tinkerer - I love putting together stuff that ranges from home servers to automating everyday tasks. If itâ€™s going make life a bit better and free up my brain for other cool ideas, Iâ€™m all in!

### My Relationship with Writing

I find a lot of value in reading about othersâ€™ life experiences - be it in the areas of technology, random musings, mental health, or even mundane accounts. So instead of just always reading, I thought Iâ€™d try my hand at sharing my own. Maybe theyâ€™ll resonate with someone out there, just like othersâ€™ have with me.

### Painting with Light as Therapy

I got into photography back in high school and fell in love with it. I even studied it in college, but trying to turn it into a career kind of sucked the joy out of it for me. Since then, Iâ€™ve been trying to bring it back into my life more as a therapeutic tool - help calm and slow down my ever racing mind.
