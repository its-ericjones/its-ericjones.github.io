    <h1>Eric Jones</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I’m a technology enthusiast - 👨🏼‍💻, casual writer - ✍🏼, and all around 
    nerd - 🤓. Recently I’ve been deeply exploring the expansive world of self hosting 
    along with a greater sense of online privacy and information security. My latest 
    interest has been finding all sorts of different ways to automate tasks in my digital 
    life with scripting in either Python or Bash. You’ll see that parts of this website 
    that will be home to guides that I’ve written - mainly so I don’t forget - on how to 
    set up servers and different self hosted solutions. Other parts will be writings more 
    akin to reflection pieces or little things that I discover and want to share with 
    others. Welcome to my little piece of the Internet - 👻.</p>
