    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>Hi there! I’m a technology enthusiast - 👨🏼‍💻, casual writer - ✍🏼, and all around nerd - 🤓. Recently I’ve been deeply exploring the expansive world of self hosting along with a greater sense of online privacy and information security. My latest interest has been finding all sorts of different ways to automate tasks in my digital life with scripting in either Python or Bash. You’ll see that parts of this website that will be home to guides that I’ve written - mainly so I don’t forget - on how to set up servers and different self hosted solutions. Other parts will be writings more akin to reflection pieces or little things that I discover and want to share with others. Welcome to my little piece of the Internet - 👻.</p>
