        <p>Hi there! I’m a technology enthusiast, casual writer, and all around nerd!</p>
        
        <p>Some of my latest interests include automating tasks my digital life with scripting in either Python or Bash, learning more about self hosting, and creating a greater sense of online privacy and information security. For more of what else I've been up to, check out what I'm doing <a href="./now.html">now</a>.</p>
        
        <p>If you're interested in the hardware and software that I'm <a href="./using.html">using</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Below are guides that I’ve written - mainly so I don’t forget - on how to set up servers and different self hosted solutions. Other posts will be my thoughts more akin to reflection pieces or little things that I discover and want to share with others. I'll also be including all the past and current programming related projects that I've created - large and small. </p>
        
        <p>Welcome to my little piece of the Internet!</p>
