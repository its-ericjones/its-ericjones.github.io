    <h1>Hey there, I’m Eric 👋🏼 👨🏼‍💻</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my little home on the Internet! Feel free to come on in, kick back, and stay a while!</p>

    <strong>Check out my tech endeavors.</strong>
    <p>I’m just a hobbyist programmer and tinkerer - I love putting together stuff that ranges from home servers to automating everyday tasks. If it’s going make life a bit better and free up my brain for other cool ideas, I’m all in!</p>

    <strong>My Relationship with Writing</strong>
    <p>I find a lot of value in reading about others’ life experiences - be it in the areas of technology, random musings, mental health, or even mundane accounts. So instead of just always reading, I thought I’d try my hand at sharing my own. Maybe they’ll resonate with someone out there, just like others’ have with me.</p>

    <strong>Painting with Light as Therapy</strong>
    <p>I got into photography back in high school and fell in love with it. I even studied it in college, but trying to turn it into a career kind of sucked the joy out of it for me. Since then, I’ve been trying to bring it back into my life more as a therapeutic tool - help calm and slow down my ever racing mind.</p>
