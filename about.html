      <h1>Myself</h1>
      <p>Hello there!</p> 
      <p>I'm a technology enthusiast, with a keen interest in writing and a deep love for all things nerdy. Recently, I've been focusing on automating my digital life using Python, AppleScript, or Bash, and exploring the world of self-hosting.</p>
      <p>In this space, you'll find a collection of guides I've created - mainly for personal reference - on setting up servers and various self-hosted solutions. You'll also find some random thoughts, reflections, and cool stuff I come across. And of course, I'll be showing off my programming projects - big and small.</p>
      <p>Thank you for joining me in this journey of exploration and discovery!</p>
